# Decoding Istanbul’s Vehicular Veins: A Network Science Exploration of Metropolitan Traffic Dynamics

This project employs the techniques of network science to investigate and discern the underlying
patterns of traffic flow in Istanbul, one of the world’s busiest cities. Using the data collected by
the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, we seek to identify and analyze the major traffic nodes
and intersections that exert a significant influence on the city’s overall traffic dynamics. The
objective of our research is to understand the complex and interrelated systems that contribute to
the unique traffic behavior of Istanbul and identify critical points of congestion. With a network
science approach, we propose a model that incorporates spatial correlation and linear diffusion
across different locations, drawing on various traffic parameters. The results from this investigation
include an identification of the key locations on overall traffic flow and a better understanding of
traffic pattern variations. The insights from this research will not only address Istanbul’s traffic
congestion issues but will also enrich the broader field of urban traffic systems, aiding strategic
transportation planning in other metropolitan cities grappling with similar challenges.
